.. _installation-for-development :

Installation for development
****************************

Installation for development should let you able to have an access to the source code, upload the code to our CVS (i.e. `git`_), and working with `composer`_.

As Chill is divided into modules, each module has his own repository.

Installation and big picture
-----------------------------

At first, you should install Chill as described in the :ref:`basic-installation` section.

Two things must be modified : 

At first, You should add the `--prefer-source` argument when you create project. 

.. code-block:: bash

   php composer.phar create-project champs-libres/chill-standard \
     path/to/your/directory --stability=dev --prefer-source

Secondly, if composer ask you the following question : ::

  Do you want to remove the existing VCS (.git, .svn..) history? [Y,n]?

**You should answer `n` (no).**

This will install a project. All downloaded modules will be stored in the `/vendor` directories. In those directories, you will have access to the git commands.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd vendor/champs-libres/chill-main/
    $ git remote -v
    composer	git://github.com/Champs-Libres/ChillMain.git (fetch)
    composer	git://github.com/Champs-Libres/ChillMain.git (push)
    origin	git://github.com/Champs-Libres/ChillMain.git (fetch)
    origin	git@github.com:Champs-Libres/ChillMain.git (push)

Working with your own fork
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning

    This section has not been tested yet. Feedback wanted.

Ideally, you will work on a fork of the main github repository. To ensure that composer will download the code from **your** repository, you will have to adapt the `composer.json` file accordingly, using your own repository. 

Add the following lines to your composer.json file if you want to force composer to download from your own repository. This will force to use your own repository for the ChillMain bundle, insert in `composer.json` the following lines : 

.. code-block:: json

    "repositories": [
       {
         "type": "git",
         "url": "git://github.com/your-github-username/ChillMain.git"
       }
    ]

You may also `use aliases <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/aliases.md>`_ to define versions.

.. _editing-code-and-commiting :

Editing the code and commiting
------------------------------

You may edit code in the `vendor/path/to/the/bundle` directory.

After your edits, you should commit as usually : 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd vendor/path/to/bundle
    $ git status 
    Sur la branche master
    Votre branche est à jour avec 'origin/master'.

    rien à valider, la copie de travail est propre

.. warning

    The git command must be run from you vendor bundle's path (`vendor/path/to/bundle`). 

Tips
^^^^

The command `composer status` (`see composer documentation <https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#status>`_) will give you and idea of which bundle has been edited :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd ./../../ #back to the root project directory
    $ composer status
    You have changes in the following dependencies:
    /path/to/your/project/install/vendor/champs-libres/chill-main
    Use --verbose (-v) to see modified files
