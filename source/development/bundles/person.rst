Search terms
*************

The class `Chill\PersonBundle\Search\PersonSearch` provide the search module.

Domain
=======

The search upon "person" is provided by default. The `@person` domain search may be omitted.

* `@person` is the domain search for people.


Arguments
=========

* `firstname` : provide the search on firstname. Example : `firstname:Depardieu`. May match part of the firstname (`firsname:dep` will match **Dep**ardieu)
* `lastname` : provide the search on lastname. May match part of the lastname.
* `birthdate` : provide the search on the birthdate. Example : `birthdate:1996-01-19`
* `gender`: performs search on man/woman. The accepted values are `man` or `woman`.
* `nationality` : performs search on nationality. Value must be a country code `as described in ISO 3166 <http://www.iso.org/iso/fr/home/standards/country_codes.htm>`_. Example : `nationality:FR`.

Default
=======

The default search is performed on firstname and/or lastname. Both are concatened before search. If values are separated by spaces, the clause `AND` is used : the search `dep ge` will match '**GÃ©**rard **Dep**ardieu` or 'Jean **Dep**a**ge**lles', but not 'Charline **Dep**ardieu' (missing 'Ge' in word).
